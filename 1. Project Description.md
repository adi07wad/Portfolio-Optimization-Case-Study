# Project Description
## Executive Summary 
Managing technical teams poses unique challenges. We considered and addressed them in the initial planning stages of our technical project. In this case study we had difficulties in the planning portion of our project that lead to reduced time in validation of our submission. We have outlined a prefered process to address the potential issues to help provide better management of our present and future projects. The goal is to prevent some common pitfalls of technical teams without extensive project management experience. 

## Problem Statement
### Problem Description 
Portfolio optimization refers to the problem of constructing an optimal portfolio of stocks. The common objective will be to maximize investment return with a given level of risk, or to minimize risk with a given level of return. 

In reality, investors have to consider some other constraints such as limits on the number of unique assets in the portfolio or how many assets outside a specified benchmark can or must be added. 

Our challenge was to develop an equity portfolio optimization framework that improves returns as it compares to a benchmark portfolio with a same or slightly higher risk level. The optimization framework minimized the trade-off between risk, in the form of tracking error, and expected excess return through time, subject to several constraints. This problem represented a basic Markowitz portfolio optimization problem.

### Data Description
We are given...
- Covariance data was supplied in a long format and was given for every four weeks over a ten year period from 01-03-2007 to 12-21-2016. 

- The time series data supplied included the names, SEDOL, Sector, bench weight, etc. for the stocks used in the benchmark portfolio at a given time. 

- See Appendix 2 in the project execution section for more information

### Our Solution
We created three functions to reorganize the given data to create a complete covariance matrix, to calculate portfolio variance with our data, and to create an optimized portfolio using Markowitz principles with added constraints. We calculated the benchmark portfolio performance and created comparison metrics to contrast our solution versus the benchmark. 

### Outcome Description 
The outcome description is a Markowitz portfolio optimized by our algorithm integrated with several constraints as stated in the problem description. The key output is the list of stocks and their optimized weights. 

### Solution Assessment and Impact 
Once we had our algorithms created we ran our program of algorithms to construct our portfolios and fill a table to hold the comparison metrics. As a result, our constrained portfolio outperformed the benchmark by a factor of 9x, after the 10-year time frame our portfolio model cumulative returns were 388% where the benchmarks was 44%.
